This site contains assorted notes and posts on ML, in the broadest sense possible, and other random topics. We donâ€™t really have a clear theme or reader in mind, and are not sure it deserves to be called a blog. It might instead turn out to be a good place to organise our thougts and keep some notes, in which case the reader is us in six months time.

This site is powered by [quarto](https://quarto.org/), github and all the other cool tech they in turn leverage.
